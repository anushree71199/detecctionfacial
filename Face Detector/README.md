# Face_Detection
A face detector generally is the one ML project which helps in detecting a face from any angle to let the user know their face is being detected by the respective app. Now-a-days when using a filter we can see this sort of detections on our phone screens.
Hope you like this little project as a beginner :)

# Steps:
1. Install the libraries if can't then try running few commands on the cmd.exe prompt, this will help too.
2. Try running it on Jupyter notebook as it will helping in identifying the identation.
-[X] Don't do all of this code in one code shell it will create confusion only, so try doing it as specified in the .py file.
